I thought that I was free but it is not true
A wall stands in my way to freedom. Bricks, stones…
Masonry patterns… Maybe so are the trees and rivers
Columbs and dams: walls of obstacles
Barries, impediments, burlesque fortresses...
As a landscape winter fills my view with snow
The silent wind forms a wall in front my eyes!
And then nothingness, death´s song is constant
My heart is broken. My feet are without shoes
And my hands are without flesh
